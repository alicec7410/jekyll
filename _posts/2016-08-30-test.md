# Useful online resources on learning web design & development #


Two months ago, I started to learn web design and development. Thanks to Google, Youtube and other online resources, I have found lots of courses about HTML, CSS, JavaScripts and learned them without paying a dime.

I want to share a few bloggers, notes, books and other resources that I find useful during my learning experience. I believe that for people who have no prior knowledge can build a simple website from scratch like I do.

### Vloggers: ###
[funfunfunction](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q): Mattias Petter Johansson is currently the front-end developer at Spotify. He makes complex JavaScripts concept interesting and easy to understand.

[Devtips](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners):Travis Neilson. If you are interested in web design and wondering how to make beautiful websites from scratch, he is definitely your go-to mentor. He currently works for Google as an interaction designer.

If you find more great Vloggers on the tech field, please share with me! :)


### Books: ###
[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/): This will help you understand how JavaScript works.

### Online courses: ###
Places like [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) are great places to start, but keep in mind that they are designed for people with no prior knowledge or experience in web design. Once you got the basic skill, you should move forward to more complicated things like HTML syntax, CSS processor, JavaScript closure etc.

Sometimes, it can be frustrated when the code doesn't work out, it's okay. I am still a noob and there are so many things I am not familiar with. It's okay to take a deep breath or even take a break just to relax. But don't forget to come back and learn more, cz it's an amazing world out there and you should be part of it. :)
